# Predicting_Customer_Churn
A project to analyze and predict customer churn using a dataset of customer interactions. This Jupyter Notebook walks through the process of data loading, exploration, preprocessing, and building machine learning models to predict whether a customer will churn or not
Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, and understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn is key to maintaining a loyal customer base. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset to predict customer churn using various machine learning models.

Features
Data Loading and Exploration: Load and explore the dataset to understand the key factors influencing churn.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for model building.
Modeling: Train multiple machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
